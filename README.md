Pet Picker

Pet Picker is my first Python project. This simple command-line tool recommends the most suitable pet based on user preferences, such as budget, space, daily attention, and energy levels.


# To use the script:

Make sure you have Python installed.
Clone this repository or download the pet_picker.py file.
Open a terminal and run:
python pet_picker.py
Answer the questions, and the script will suggest the best pet for you!

# Features

- Interactive Q&A format
- Simple decision-making logic
- Beginner-friendly Python implementation
